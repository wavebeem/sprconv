# SprConv

A python tool for decompiling and recompiling Quake sprites.

### Example usage:

Decompile sprite: `sprconv sprite.spr`

Compile sprite: `sprconv sprite.json`

Use in other scripts:

```python
from sprconv import sprite_from_json
from sprconv import json_from_sprite

sprite_from_json(json_filename)
json_from_sprite(sprite_filename)
```

### Example JSON script:

```json
{
    "filename": "s_light.spr",
    "version": 1,
    "type": 2,
    "size": [32, 32],
    "bounding_radius": 22.627416610717773,
    "beam_length": 0.0,
    "sync_type": 0,
    "frames": [
        {
            "type": 0,
            "subframes": [
                {
                    "filename": "s_light_0_0.png",
                    "size": [32, 32],
                    "origin": [-16, 16],
                    "interval": 0.1
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Versions:

- 1: Normal Quake. Input images must be paletted (8bpp).
- 32: Darkplaces. Input images must be RGBA (32bpp).

### Sprite types:

- 0: Parallel upright
- 1: Facing upright
- 2: Parallel
- 3: Oriented
- 4: Parallel oriented

### Sync types:

- 0: Synchronized
- 1: Random

### Frame types:

- 0: Single
- 1: Group
- 2: Angled (FTEQW only)

### Notes:

- "bounding_radius" is not used by most sourceports, so can safely be set to 0.
- I'm not sure what "beam_length" is used for in any version of Quake.
- "interval" is the length of time between subframes in Group frames.
